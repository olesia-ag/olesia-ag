## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Olesia (she/her), a recent bootcamp grad with a passion for front end technologies and React.js in particular. I keep diving deeper in its internals along with principles of JS functional programming 


#### currently working my way through [Advanced CSS and Sass on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) and improving design of my [personal website](https://www.olesiag.com/)

#### When I'm not doing anything aforementioned, I can be found running in the park :running: rereading Harry Potter books :crystal_ball: or dancing in front of the mirror ~like nobody's watching~ :dancer:
