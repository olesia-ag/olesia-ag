## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Olesia (she/her), a recent bootcamp grad with a passion for front end technologies and React.js in particular. I keep diving deeper in its internals along with principles of JS functional programming 


#### currently learining: working my way through [Advanced CSS and Sass on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) and [React Testing with Jest and Enzyme] (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme/)

#### currently working on: building social network for movie lovers using React.js and Firebase:  [here](https://github.com/olesia-ag/movie_social/)

#### When I'm not doing anything aforementioned, I can be found running in the park :running: reading nonfiction :nerd_face: or dancing in front of the mirror ~like nobody's watching~ :dancer:
